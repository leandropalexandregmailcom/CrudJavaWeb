# CrudJavaWeb
This project is a users crud, it was made with java web. I also used SOLID principles and some design patterns to do it. The design patterns I used were singleton, command and factory.

To start this project, you will need jdk, jre, apache server, postgres database, you will also have to configure the connection variables with your
database in the Connection.java file in the Connection package. After configuring these softwares, this project can be run.
